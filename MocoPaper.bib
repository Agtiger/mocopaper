  abstract = {Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are common, and children as young as 10 years of age exhibit movement patterns associated with an ACL injury risk. Prevention programs have been shown to reduce injury rates, but the mechanisms behind these programs are largely unknown. Few studies have investigated biomechanical changes after injury prevention programs in children. To investigate the effects of the F-MARC 11+ injury prevention warm-up program on changes to biomechanical risk factors for an ACL injury in preadolescent female soccer players. We hypothesized that the primary ACL injury risk factor of peak knee valgus moment would improve after training. In addition, we explored other kinematic and kinetic variables associated with ACL injuries. Controlled laboratory study. A total of 51 female athletes aged 10 to 12 years were recruited from soccer clubs and were placed into an intervention group (n = 28; mean [±SD] age, 11.8 ± 0.8 years) and a control group (n = 23; mean age, 11.2 ± 0.6 years). The intervention group participated in 15 in-season sessions of the F-MARC 11+ program (2 times/wk). Pre- and postseason motion capture data were collected during preplanned cutting, unanticipated cutting, double-leg jump, and single-leg jump tasks. Lower extremity joint angles and moments were estimated using OpenSim, a biomechanical modeling system. Athletes in the intervention group reduced their peak knee valgus moment compared with the control group during the double-leg jump (mean [±standard error of the mean] pre- to posttest change, –0.57 ± 0.27 \%BW×HT vs 0.25 ± 0.25 \%BW×HT, respectively; P = .034). No significant differences in the change in peak knee valgus moment were found between the groups for any other activity; however, the intervention group displayed a significant pre- to posttest increase in peak knee valgus moment during unanticipated cutting (P = .044). Additional analyses revealed an improvement in peak ankle eversion moment after training during preplanned cutting (P = .015), unanticipated cutting (P = .004), and the double-leg jump (P = .016) compared with the control group. Other secondary risk factors did not significantly improve after training, although the peak knee valgus angle improved in the control group compared with the intervention group during unanticipated cutting (P = .018). The F-MARC 11+ program may be effective in improving some risk factors for an ACL injury during a double-leg jump in preadolescent athletes, most notably by reducing peak knee valgus moment. This study provides motivation for enhancing injury prevention programs to produce improvement in other ACL risk factors, particularly during cutting and single-leg tasks.},

Our computations are able to predict motions and forces of the human and exoskeleton that are within the torque limits of a subject.

  journal = {Journal of Biomechanical Engineering}, 
  abstract = {Prevention of muscle atrophy caused by reduced mechanical loading in microgravity conditions remains a challenge for long-duration spaceflight. To combat leg muscle atrophy, astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS) often perform squat exercise using the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED). While the ARED is effective at building muscle strength and volume on Earth, NASA researchers do not know how closely ARED squat exercise on the ISS replicates Earth-level squat muscle moments, or how small variations in exercise form affect muscle loading. This study used dynamic simulations of ARED squat exercise on the ISS to address these two questions. A multibody dynamic model of the complete astronaut-ARED system was constructed in OpenSim. With the ARED base locked to ground and gravity set to 9.81 m/s2, we validated the model by reproducing muscle moments, ground reaction forces, and foot center of pressure (CoP) positions for ARED squat exercise on Earth. With the ARED base free to move relative to the ISS and gravity set to zero, we then used the validated model to simulate ARED squat exercise on the ISS for a reference squat motion and eight altered squat motions involving changes in anterior–posterior (AP) foot or CoP position on the ARED footplate. The reference squat motion closely reproduced Earth-level muscle moments for all joints except the ankle. For the altered squat motions, changing the foot position was more effective at altering muscle moments than was changing the CoP position. All CoP adjustments introduced an undesirable shear foot reaction force that could cause the feet to slip on the ARED footplate, while some foot and CoP adjustments introduced an undesirable sagittal plane foot reaction moment that would cause the astronaut to rotate off the ARED footplate without the use of some type of foot fixation. Our results provide potentially useful information for achieving desired increases or decreases in specific muscle moments during ARED squat exercise performed on the ISS.},

Understanding how neuromuscular control is altered in CP can provide insight into pathological movement. We sought to determine if individuals with CP demonstrate reduced complexity of neuromuscular control during gait compared with unimpaired individuals and if changes in control are related to functional ability. Muscle synergies during gait were retrospectively analyzed for 633 individuals (age range 3.9–70y): 549 with CP (hemiplegia, n=122; diplegia, n=266; triplegia, n=73; quadriplegia, n=88) and 84 unimpaired individuals. Synergies were calculated using non-negative matrix factorization from surface electromyography collected during previous clinical gait analyses. Synergy complexity during gait was compared with diagnosis subtype, functional ability, and clinical examination measures. Fewer synergies were required to describe muscle activity during gait in individuals with CP compared with unimpaired individuals. Changes in synergies were related to functional impairment and clinical examination measures including selective motor control, strength, and spasticity. Individuals with CP use a simplified control strategy during gait compared with unimpaired individuals. These results were similar to synergies during walking among adult stroke survivors, suggesting similar neuromuscular control strategies between these clinical populations.},

  journal = {Journal of Orthopaedic Research}, 
  abstract = {Gait modification offers a noninvasive option for offloading the medial compartment of the knee in patients with knee osteoarthritis. While gait modifications have been proposed based on their ability to reduce the external knee adduction moment, no gait pattern has been proven to reduce medial compartment contact force directly. This study used in vivo contact force data collected from a single subject with a force-measuring knee replacement to evaluate the effectiveness of two gait patterns at achieving this goal. The first was a “medial thrust” gait pattern that involved medializing the knee during stance phase, while the second was a “walking pole” gait pattern that involved using bilateral walking poles commonly used for hiking. Compared to the subject's normal gait pattern, medial thrust gait produced a 16\% reduction and walking pole gait a 27\% reduction in medial contact force over stance phase, both of which were statistically significant based on a two-tailed Mann–Whitney U-test. While medial thrust gait produced little change in lateral and total contact force over the stance phase, walking pole gait produced significant 11\% and 21\% reductions, respectively. Medial thrust gait may allow patients with knee osteoarthritis to reduce medial contact force using a normal-looking walking motion requiring no external equipment, while walking pole gait may allow patients with knee osteoarthritis or a knee replacement to reduce medial, lateral, and total contact force in situations where the use of walking poles is possible. © 2009 Orthopaedic Research Society.

  abstract = {Currently, control of exoskeletons in rehabilitation focuses on imposing desired trajectories to promote relearning of motions. Furthermore, assistance is often provided by imposing these desired trajectories using impedance controllers. However, lower-limb exoskeletons are also a promising solution for mobility problems of individuals in daily life. To develop an assistive exoskeleton which allows the user to be autonomous, i.e. in control of his motions, remains a challenge. This paper presents a model-based control method to tackle this challenge. The model-based control method utilizes a dynamic model of the exoskeleton to compensate for its own dynamics. After this compensation of the exoskeleton dynamics, the exoskeleton can provide a desired assistance to the user. While dynamic models of exoskeletons used in the literature focus on gravity compensation only, the need for modelling and monitoring of the ground contact impedes their widespread use. The control strategy proposed here relies on modelling of the full exoskeleton dynamics and of the contacts with the environment. A modelling strategy and general control scheme are introduced. Validation of the control method on 15 non-disabled adults performing sit-to-stand motions shows that muscle effort and joint torques are similar in the conditions with dynamically compensated exoskeleton and without exoskeleton. The condition with exoskeleton in which the compensating controller was not active showed a significant increase in human joint torques and muscle effort at the knee and hip. Motor saturation occurred during the assisted condition, which limited the assistance the exoskeleton could deliver. This work presents the modelling steps and controller design to compensate the exoskeleton dynamics. The validation seems to indicate that the presented model-based controller is able to compensate the exoskeleton.},

Using dynamic optimization to compute excitation patterns comes at a large computational cost, which has limited the use of muscle-actuated simulations. This paper introduces a new algorithm, which we call computed muscle control, that uses static optimization along with feedforward and feedback controls to drive the kinematic trajectory of a musculoskeletal model toward a set of desired kinematics. We illustrate the algorithm by computing a set of muscle excitations that drive a 30-muscle, 3-degree-of-freedom model of pedaling to track measured pedaling kinematics and forces. Only 10min of computer time were required to compute muscle excitations that reproduced the measured pedaling dynamics, which is over two orders of magnitude faster than conventional dynamic optimization techniques. Simulated kinematics were within 1° of experimental values, simulated pedal forces were within one standard deviation of measured pedal forces for nearly all of the crank cycle, and computed muscle excitations were similar in timing to measured electromyographic patterns. The speed and accuracy of this new algorithm improves the feasibility of using detailed musculoskeletal models to simulate and analyze movement.},

  journal = {Journal of Biomechanics}, 
  abstract = {The aim of this study was to perform full-body three-dimensional (3D) dynamic optimization simulations of human locomotion by driving a neuromusculoskeletal model toward in vivo measurements of body-segmental kinematics and ground reaction forces. Gait data were recorded from 5 healthy participants who walked at their preferred speeds and ran at 2m/s. Participant-specific data-tracking dynamic optimization solutions were generated for one stride cycle using direct collocation in tandem with an OpenSim-MATLAB interface. The body was represented as a 12-segment, 21-degree-of-freedom skeleton actuated by 66 muscle-tendon units. Foot-ground interaction was simulated using six contact spheres under each foot. The dynamic optimization problem was to find the set of muscle excitations needed to reproduce 3D measurements of body-segmental motions and ground reaction forces while minimizing the time integral of muscle activations squared. Direct collocation took on average 2.7±1.0h and 2.2±1.6h of CPU time, respectively, to solve the optimization problems for walking and running. Model-computed kinematics and foot-ground forces were in good agreement with corresponding experimental data while the calculated muscle excitation patterns were consistent with measured EMG activity. The results demonstrate the feasibility of implementing direct collocation on a detailed neuromusculoskeletal model with foot-ground contact to accurately and efficiently generate 3D data-tracking dynamic optimization simulations of human locomotion. The proposed method offers a viable tool for creating feasible initial guesses needed to perform predictive simulations of movement using dynamic optimization theory.

In this study, we construct a predictive simulation framework based on energy minimization and use it to generate normal walking, along with walking with a range of carried loads and up a range of inclines. The simulation is muscle-driven and includes controllers based on muscle force and stretch reflexes and contact state of the legs. We demonstrate how human-like locomotor strategies emerge from adapting the model to a range of environmental changes. Our simulation dynamics not only show good agreement with experimental data for normal walking on flat ground (92\% of joint angle trajectories and 78\% of joint torque trajectories lie within 1 standard deviation of experimental data), but also reproduce many of the salient changes in joint angles, joint moments, muscle coordination, and metabolic energy expenditure observed in experimental studies of loaded and inclined walking.},

This chapter provide an overview of optimal control theory applied specifically to studying the biomechanics and control of human movement. In this approach, the human neuromusculoskeletal system is modeled as a system of ordinary differential equations subject to controls that influence the behavior of the system. Techniques from control theory are used to find the optimal controls that cause the model to behave in a manner that minimizes or maximizes a user-defined performance criterion. The performance criterion, along with any task requirements, mathematically define the goal of the movement to be simulated. This framework has proven to be both powerful and flexible, leading to fundamental insights on topics ranging from the biomechanical function of individual muscles in locomotion to the manner in which the nervous system controls limb movements in reaching tasks. Many of the basic concepts that are introduced in the first half of this chapter are then demonstrated via a detailed example of the optimal control of human walking. Selected contemporary topics that hold promise for the future are discussed, as are challenges with the use of optimal control theory. The chapter concludes with perspectives on future developments in the application of optimal control theory to human movement.},
